## Quick Setup
For those who prefer a quick setup, the GNS3 project is available in portable format via the following links. There are two versions:

- [LFCS-GNS3-Portable-NoImages](https://mega.nz/folder/edd2GKia#8TYTBFtv_aiHL_fJr9XBOg): Contains the complete project without the qcow images.
- [LFCS-GNS3-Portable-Full](https://mega.nz/folder/rIFEwYrY#AYieH6XuZ5KTPSBEH7gqlA): Contains the complete project, including the qcow images.

Both versions are compressed in 7zip format and split into 1 GiB archive files.
